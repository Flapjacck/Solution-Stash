## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1724918442/)

## Notes

This solution adds two numbers represented as linked lists (digits stored in reverse order) using elementary school addition:

1. Initialize a dummy node to simplify result list construction
2. Use a carry variable to handle overflow when digit sum > 9
3. Process both lists simultaneously while handling different lengths:
   - Extract digit values (use 0 if node doesn't exist)
   - Calculate total = digit1 + digit2 + carry
   - New digit = total % 10, new carry = total // 10
4. Continue until both lists are exhausted AND no carry remains
5. Return dummy.next (the actual result list)

Key insights:

- Numbers are stored in reverse order, so we can add from least significant digit
- Handle lists of different lengths by treating missing nodes as 0
- Don't forget to handle final carry (e.g., 999 + 1 = 1000)

### Time Complexity: O(max(m, n))

Where m and n are the lengths of the two input linked lists:

- We iterate through both lists once simultaneously
- Processing continues until the longer list is exhausted and carry is 0
- Each node operation (addition, node creation) takes O(1)
- Overall complexity is O(max(m, n))

### Space Complexity: O(max(m, n))

Where m and n are the lengths of the two input linked lists:

- Result list length is at most max(m, n) + 1 (due to final carry)
- We create one new node for each digit in the result: O(max(m, n))
- A few variables (carry, current, dummy) use O(1) space
- Overall space complexity is O(max(m, n)) 

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Initialize dummy node for result list
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        current = dummy
        carry = 0
        
        # Process both lists while nodes exist or there's a carry
        while l1 or l2 or carry:
            # Get values from lists, use 0 if no node
            x = l1.val if l1 else 0
            y = l2.val if l2 else 0
            
            # Calculate sum and new carry
            total = x + y + carry
            carry = total // 10
            digit = total % 10
            
            # Create new node with current digit
            current.next = ListNode(digit)
            current = current.next
            
            # Move to next nodes if available
            l1 = l1.next if l1 else None
            l2 = l2.next if l2 else None
        
        return dummy.next
