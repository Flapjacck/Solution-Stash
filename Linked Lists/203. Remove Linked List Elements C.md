# 203. Remove Linked List Elements

## [C Solution](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1439425220/)

## Notes

- First, need to make a new linked list node to iterate through the list, make it the current node as well (helps if the head needs to be removed)
- Need to travese the list to find the node that matches the key value
- If found need to set it to a temp node, that will be freed (removed)
- Also set the current node->next to skip the to_delete node
- if not found move to the next node
- return the new head

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     struct ListNode *next;
 * };
 */
struct ListNode* removeElements(struct ListNode* head, int val) {
    //Define a temporary node to act as a temp head
    struct ListNode temp;
    temp.next = head;
    struct ListNode* current = &temp;

    //Iterate through the list
    while (current->next != NULL) {
        if (current->next->val == val) {
            //Remove the node
            //make variable to be freed
            struct ListNode* to_delete = current->next;
            //set the curr next to skip the to_delete
            current->next = current->next->next;
            //free the memory of the to-delete node
            free(to_delete);
        } else {
            // Move to the next node
            current = current->next;
        }
    }
    //Return the new head of the list
    return temp.next;
}
```
