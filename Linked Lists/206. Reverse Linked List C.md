# 206. Reverse Linked List

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1440113858/)

## Notes

- Need to make a new head for the reversed list
- Also need to set the head to a node for traversal (curr_node)
- Traverse the list while curr_node != NULL
- Set a new node to the next node og list
- Set the next node to the prev node in reversed list
- Move through both lists for next iteration
- Retrun the head of the reversed list


```c
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     struct ListNode *next;
 * };
 */
struct ListNode* reverseList(struct ListNode* head) {
    //New head for reversed list
    struct ListNode* prev = NULL;
    //Head set to curr for list traversal 
    struct ListNode* curr_node = head;

    //Iterate through the list until end
    while (curr_node != NULL) {
        //Set a new node to the next node in og list
        struct ListNode* next = curr_node->next;
        //Set the next node to the prev node in rev list
        curr_node->next = prev;
        //Set prev to curr node for the next iteration
        prev = curr_node;
        //Set curr to next for the next iteration
        curr_node = next;
    }
    
    //Return the head node of the rev list
    return prev;
}
```
