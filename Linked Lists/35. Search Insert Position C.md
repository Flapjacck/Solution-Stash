# 35. Search Insert Position

## [Solution Link]()

## Notes

- Use binary search to achieve O(log n) runtime complexity.

- Initialize two pointers, left at the start and right at the end of the array.

- While left is less than or equal to right, calculate the middle index and compare the middle element with the target.

- If the target is found, return the middle index; if not, adjust the pointers accordingly and return the insertion index when the loop ends.
