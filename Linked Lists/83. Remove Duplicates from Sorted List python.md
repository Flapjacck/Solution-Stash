# [83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/description/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1606940822/)

## Notes

1. First checking if the list is empty - if so, return immediately
2. Using a single pointer (`curr`) that starts at the head and moves through the list
3. For each node, comparing its value with the next node's value:
   - If they are equal (a duplicate is found), we bypass the next node by setting `curr.next = curr.next.next`
   - If they are different, we advance our pointer to the next node with `curr = curr.next`
4. The algorithm takes advantage of the fact that the list is already sorted, so duplicates will always be adjacent

### Time Complexity: O(n)

Where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The algorithm traverses each node at most once.

### Space Complexity: O(1)

The solution uses constant extra space regardless of input size, as we only use a single pointer to track our position.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head:
            return head
        curr = head

        while curr.next:
            if curr.val == curr.next.val:
                curr.next = curr.next.next
            else:
                curr = curr.next
        return head
```
