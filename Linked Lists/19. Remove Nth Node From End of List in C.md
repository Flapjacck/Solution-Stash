# [19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/description/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1827209804/)

## Notes

- Compute the list length with a single pass, then remove the (len - n)-th node (0-based) by adjusting pointers.
- Handle removal of the head as a special case (when len - n == 0).
- This approach is simple and avoids using an extra dummy node or two-pointer trick; it trades a second pass for clarity.

### Time Complexity: O(n)

Where n is the number of nodes in the list:

- We traverse the list once to compute its length and then again to reach the node before the one to remove: O(n) overall.

### Space Complexity: O(1)

- Only a few pointer and integer variables are used; no additional data structures are allocated.

```c
struct ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(struct ListNode* head, int n) {
    if (!head) return NULL;

    // correct length count
    int len = 0;
    struct ListNode* curr = head;
    while (curr) { len++; curr = curr->next; }

    int idx = len - n;                // 0-based index of node to remove
    if (idx == 0) {                   // remove head
        struct ListNode* del = head;
        head = head->next;
        free(del);
        return head;
    }

    curr = head;                      // move to node BEFORE target
    for (int i = 1; i < idx; ++i) curr = curr->next;

    struct ListNode* del = curr->next;
    curr->next = del->next;
    free(del);
    return head;
}
```
