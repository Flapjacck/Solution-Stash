# [567. Permutation in String](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/description/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1635870574/)

## Notes

This solution uses the sliding window technique with hash maps to find if a permutation of pattern exists in text:

1. Create frequency maps for both pattern and current window
2. Use two pointers (left and right) to maintain a window of size len(pattern)
3. For each window:
   - Add right character to window_count
   - When window size equals pattern size:
     - Check if frequency maps match
     - Remove leftmost character and slide window
4. Return true if any window matches pattern frequencies

### Time Complexity: O(n)

Where n is the length of the text string:

- Building pattern frequency map: O(m) where m is pattern length
- Sliding window through text: O(n)
- Dictionary comparison is O(1) as we have at most 26 lowercase letters
- Overall complexity is O(n)

### Space Complexity: O(1)

Analysis of space used:

- target_count dictionary: O(k) where k ≤ 26 (lowercase letters)
- window_count dictionary: O(k) where k ≤ 26
- Two pointers (left, right): O(1)
- Overall space complexity is O(1) as k is bounded by alphabet size

```python
class Solution:
    def checkInclusion(self, pattern: str, text: str) -> bool:
        # Initialize pointers and frequency maps
        left = 0
        right = 0
        target_count = {}
        window_count = {}

        # Build pattern frequency map
        for char in pattern:
            target_count[char] = target_count.get(char, 0) + 1

        window_size = len(pattern)

        # Slide window through text
        while right < len(text):
            # Add right character to current window
            window_count[text[right]] = window_count.get(text[right], 0) + 1

            # Check window when it reaches pattern size
            if right - left + 1 == window_size:
                if window_count == target_count:
                    return True
                # Remove leftmost character and slide window
                window_count[text[left]] -= 1
                if window_count[text[left]] == 0:
                    del window_count[text[left]]
                left += 1
            right += 1
        return False
