# 344. Reverse String

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1511934819/)

## Notes

1. **Initialize Pointers**:
   - Initialize two pointers, `first` at the beginning of the array and `last` at the end of the array.

2. **Swap Characters**:
   - Use a while loop to swap characters until the pointers meet in the middle.
   - Swap the characters at the `first` and `last` pointers.

3. **Move Pointers**:
   - Move the `first` pointer towards the center by incrementing it.
   - Move the `last` pointer towards the center by decrementing it.

```java
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        // Initialize pointers at the beginning and end of the array
        int first = 0;
        int last = s.length - 1;

        // Swap characters until pointers meet in the middle
        while (first < last) {
            // Swap characters
            char temp = s[first];
            s[first] = s[last];
            s[last] = temp;

            // Move pointers closer to the center
            first++;
            last--;
        }
    }
}
```
