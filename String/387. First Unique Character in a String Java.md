# [387. First Unique Character in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1590330922/)

## Notes

1. Convert the input string to a character array for easier processing.
2. Create a HashMap to store the frequency of each character in the string.
3. Populate the frequency map by iterating through all characters.
4. Iterate through the character array in original order:
   - For each character, check if its frequency in the map is 1.
   - If found, return its index as the first unique character.
5. If no unique character is found, return -1.

```java
class Solution {
    public int firstUniqChar(String s) {
        // Convert the input string to a character array
        char[] characters = s.toCharArray();

        // Create a HashMap to store the frequency of each character
        HashMap<Character, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();

        // Populate the frequency map
        for (char c : characters) {
            frequencyMap.put(c, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Iterate over the character array to find the first unique character
        for (int i = 0; i < characters.length; i++) {
            // If the character's frequency is 1, return its index
            if (frequencyMap.get(characters[i]) == 1) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        // If no unique character is found, return -1
        return -1;
    }
}
