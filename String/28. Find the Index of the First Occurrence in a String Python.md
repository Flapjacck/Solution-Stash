# [28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/description/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1715143646/)

## Notes

This solution finds the first occurrence of a substring (needle) in a string (haystack) using a sliding window approach:

1. Handle edge cases:
   - Return 0 if needle is empty (by convention)
   - Return -1 if haystack is shorter than needle
2. Iterate through all possible starting positions in haystack
3. For each position, extract a substring of needle's length and compare
4. Return the index if a match is found, otherwise return -1

The key insight is to only check positions where the remaining haystack length is at least as long as the needle.

### Time Complexity: O(n * m)

Where n is the length of haystack and m is the length of needle:

- Outer loop runs at most (n - m + 1) times: O(n - m)
- String slicing and comparison takes O(m) time
- Overall complexity is O((n - m) * m) = O(n * m) in worst case

### Space Complexity: O(m)

Where m is the length of needle:

- String slicing creates a temporary substring of length m: O(m)
- All other variables use constant space: O(1)
- Overall space complexity is O(m)

```python
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        # Handle edge cases: empty needle or haystack shorter than needle
        if not needle:
            return 0
        if len(haystack) < len(needle):
            return -1
        
        # Iterate through possible starting positions in haystack
        for i in range(len(haystack) - len(needle) + 1):
            # Check if substring starting at i matches needle
            if haystack[i:i + len(needle)] == needle:
                return i
        
        # Needle not found
        return -1
```
