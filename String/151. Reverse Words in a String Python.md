# [151. Reverse Words in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/description/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1616875645/)

## Notes

This solution uses Python's built-in string methods to efficiently reverse words in a string:

1. `s.split()` splits the string by whitespace and automatically handles:
   - Multiple spaces between words
   - Leading/trailing spaces
   - Tabs and newlines
2. `reversed()` reverses the list of words
3. `" ".join()` concatenates the words back together with single spaces

### Time Complexity: O(n)

Where n is the length of the input string:

- `split()` needs to traverse the string once: O(n)
- `reversed()` needs to reverse the list of words: O(m) where m is number of words (m â‰¤ n)
- `join()` needs to concatenate all characters back: O(n)

### Space Complexity: O(n)

Where n is the length of the input string:

- We create a new list of words from split(): O(n)
- The final joined string: O(n)
- The reversed iterator is O(1)

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        return " ".join(reversed(s.split()))
```
