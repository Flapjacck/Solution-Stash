# [394. Decode String](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/description/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1626533345/)

## Notes

This solution decodes an encoded string using a recursive approach:

1. Process the string character by character until we find a closing bracket:
   - If character is a letter, add it to output
   - If character is a digit, calculate the number k
   - If character is '[', recursively decode the substring
2. For each recursive call:
   - Build the decoded substring
   - Return both the decoded string and the next position to process
3. Multiply the decoded substring by k and add to output
4. Handle nested brackets through recursion

### Time Complexity: O(maxK * n)

Where n is the length of the input string and maxK is the maximum value of k:

- We process each character once: O(n)
- For each '[', we make a recursive call: O(depth)
- String multiplication takes O(maxK * length)
- Overall complexity is O(maxK * n) due to string multiplications

### Space Complexity: O(n)

Where n is the length of the input string:

- Recursion stack can go as deep as the number of nested brackets: O(n)
- Each recursive call stores a local output string: O(n)
- The final decoded string can be up to O(maxK * n), but we only store O(n) at any time
- Overall space complexity is O(n) for the recursion stack

                    # Multiply decoded string by k and add to output
                    output += decoded * k
