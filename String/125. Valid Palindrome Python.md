# [125. Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/description/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1670966249/)

## Notes

This solution uses a two-pointer approach to check if a string is a palindrome after preprocessing:

1. **Preprocessing**: Remove all non-alphanumeric characters using regex and convert to lowercase
2. **Two-pointer technique**: Compare characters from both ends moving inward
3. **Early termination**: Return False immediately if any mismatch is found

The regex pattern `[^a-zA-Z0-9]` matches any character that is NOT alphanumeric, which gets replaced with an empty string.

### Time Complexity: O(n)

- Regex preprocessing: O(n) to scan through the entire string
- Two-pointer comparison: O(n/2) â‰ˆ O(n) in worst case
- Overall: O(n) where n is the length of the input string

### Space Complexity: O(n)

- The regex substitution creates a new string of length up to n
- All other variables use constant space
- Overall: O(n) for the processed string storage

```python
import re 

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        s = re.sub("[^a-zA-Z0-9]", "",s)
        s = s.lower()
        left, right = 0, len(s) - 1

        for i in range(len(s) // 2):
            if left == right:
                return True
            elif s[left] == s[right]:
                left += 1
                right -= 1
            else:
                return False
        return True      
```
