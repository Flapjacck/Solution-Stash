# [392. Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1601733635/)

## Notes

1. Initialize two pointers:
   - `i` for string `s` (starts at 0)
   - `j` for string `t` (starts at 0)
2. Iterate through both strings using a while loop until either string is exhausted.
3. For each character:
   - If characters at the current positions match (`s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)`), increment `i`.
   - Always increment `j` to continue checking the next character in `t`.
4. After the loop, if `i` equals the length of `s`, it means all characters in `s` were found in the same order in `t`.

### Time Complexity: O(n)

- Where n is the length of string `t` (the longer string)
- We make a single pass through string `t` in the worst case.

### Space Complexity: O(1)

- We only use two integer pointers regardless of input size.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < s.length() && j < t.length()){
            if (s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)) i++;
            j++;
        }
        return i == s.length();
    }
}
```
