# [58. Length of Last Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/description/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1607619315/)

## Notes

1. Using `strip()` to remove any leading and trailing whitespace from the string
2. Splitting the string into a list of words with `split()` (which splits on whitespace by default)
3. Accessing the last word with index `-1`
4. Returning the length of that word using `len()`

### Time Complexity: O(n)

- `strip()` requires scanning the string once - O(n)
- `split()` also requires scanning the string once - O(n)
- Accessing the last element in the list is O(1)
- Getting the length of a string is O(1)
- Overall time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string

### Space Complexity: O(n)

- `split()` creates a new list of words which in the worst case could be O(n) space
- The overall space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        return len(s.strip().split()[-1])  
```
