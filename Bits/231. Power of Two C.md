# [231. Power of Two](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/description/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1875761928/)

## Notes

This solution determines if an integer is a power of two using a bit manipulation trick:

1. **Power of two property**: A power of two has exactly one bit set in its binary representation
   - 1 = 0001, 2 = 0010, 4 = 0100, 8 = 1000, etc.
2. **Bit trick**: When you subtract 1 from a power of two, it flips all the bits after the single set bit
   - Example: 8 (1000) - 1 = 7 (0111)
3. **Bitwise AND operation**: `n & (n-1)` results in 0 only if n is a power of two
   - 8 & 7 = 1000 & 0111 = 0000 (power of 2)
   - 6 & 5 = 0110 & 0101 = 0100 (not power of 2)
4. **Edge case**: Must check `n > 0` to exclude negative numbers and zero

### Time Complexity: O(1)

- Bitwise AND operation takes constant time
- No loops or recursion
- Time doesn't depend on the input size
- Overall: O(1) - constant time

### Space Complexity: O(1)

- No additional data structures used
- Only uses a constant number of variables for the ternary operation
- Space usage doesn't depend on input size

```c
bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
    return n > 0 ? !(n & n - 1) : false;
}
```
