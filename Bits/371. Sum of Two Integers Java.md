## Notes

1. **Loop Until No Carry**:
   - The function uses a `while` loop that continues until there is no carry (`b != 0`).

2. **Calculating Carry**:
   - Inside the loop, the carry is calculated using the bitwise AND operator (`a & b`) and then left-shifted by 1 (`<< 1`).
   - This determines which bits will need to be carried over to the next higher bit position.

3. **Calculating Sum Without Carry**:
   - The sum without carry is calculated using the bitwise XOR operator (`a ^ b`).
   - This effectively adds the bits of `a` and `b` without considering the carry.

4. **Updating Carry**:
   - The carry is then assigned to `b` for the next iteration.
   - The loop continues until there are no more carry bits left.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - Once the loop exits, the final value of `a` is the sum of the two integers without using the `+` operator.
   - The function returns this value.

```java
class Solution {
    public int getSum(int a, int b) {
        // Keep going until there's no carry
        while (b != 0) {
            // Get carry bits and shift left by 1
            int carry = (a & b) << 1;
            // XOR gives sum without carry
            a = a ^ b;
            // Update carry for next iteration
            b = carry;
        }
        // Return final sum
        return a;
    }
}
```
