# [190. Reverse Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1550455855/)

## Notes

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function `reverseBits` takes an integer `n` as input.
   - An integer `reversed` is initialized to 0 to store the reversed bits.

2. **Loop Through Bits**:
   - The function uses a `for` loop that iterates 32 times since we're dealing with a 32-bit integer.

3. **Extracting Least Significant Bit**:
   - In each iteration, the least significant bit (LSB) of `n` is extracted using the bitwise AND operator (`n & 1`).

4. **Shifting and Adding Bit**:
   - The `reversed` variable is left-shifted by 1 to make space for the new bit.
   - The extracted LSB is then added to `reversed` using the bitwise OR operator (`reversed = (reversed << 1) | lsb`).

5. **Shifting Input Right**:
   - The input `n` is right-shifted by 1 using the unsigned right shift operator (`n >>> 1`) to process the next bit.

6. **Returning the Result**:
   - After the loop completes, the `reversed` variable contains the reversed bits of the original input.
   - The function returns the `reversed` value.

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        // Initialize result variable to store reversed bits, starting at 0
        int reversed = 0;
        
        // Loop 32 times since we're dealing with 32-bit integer
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            // Extract least significant bit using bitwise AND with 1
            int lsb = n & 1;
            
            // Shift reversed left by 1 and add the lsb using OR operation
            reversed = (reversed << 1) | lsb;
            
            // Unsigned right shift n by 1 to process next bit
            n = n >>> 1;
        }
        // Return the fully reversed 32-bit integer
        return reversed;
    }
}
```
