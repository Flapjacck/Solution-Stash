# [868. Binary Gap](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-gap/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1593611173/)

## Notes

1. Initialize variables:
   - `lastOneIndex` as -1 to track the index of the last seen '1' bit.
   - `maxGap` as 0 to store the maximum distance found.

2. Loop through each of the 32 bits in the integer (since an int in Java has 32 bits).

3. For each bit position:
   - Check if the bit at position i is a '1' using bit manipulation: `((N >> i) & 1) == 1`
   - If it is a '1' AND we've seen a '1' before (lastOneIndex != -1):
     - Calculate the gap between the current position and the last '1' position.
     - Update `maxGap` if this gap is larger than the current maximum.
   - Update `lastOneIndex` to the current position.

4. Return the maximum gap found.

```java
class Solution {
    public int binaryGap(int N) {
        int lastOneIndex = -1; // Stores the index of the last seen '1' bit
        int maxGap = 0;        // Stores the maximum distance between two '1's

        // Loop through all 32 bits of the integer
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; ++i) {
            // Check if the bit at position i is a '1'
            if (((N >> i) & 1) == 1) {
                // If this is not the first '1', calculate the gap and update maxGap if needed
                if (lastOneIndex != -1) {
                    maxGap = Math.max(maxGap, i - lastOneIndex);
                }
                // Update the last seen '1' bit index
                lastOneIndex = i;
            }
        }

        return maxGap;
    }
}

```
