# [9. Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1730490482/)

## Notes

This solution determines if an integer is a palindrome using an optimized half-reversal approach:

1. **Handle edge cases**: Return false for negative numbers or numbers ending in 0 (except 0 itself)
2. **Reverse only half the number**: Instead of reversing the entire number, we reverse only the second half
3. **Stop condition**: Continue until the original number becomes smaller than or equal to the reversed part
4. **Palindrome check**: Compare original and reversed parts:
   - For even-length numbers: x == reversed
   - For odd-length numbers: x == reversed / 10 (ignore middle digit)

Key advantages over full reversal:

- Prevents integer overflow issues
- More efficient (only processes half the digits)
- Elegant handling of both even and odd-length numbers

### Time Complexity: O(log n)

Where n is the input number:

- We process approximately half the digits of the number
- Each iteration involves constant time operations (division, modulo)
- Number of digits in n is log₁₀(n), so we process log₁₀(n)/2 digits
- Overall complexity is O(log n)

### Space Complexity: O(1)

The algorithm uses constant extra space:

- Only uses two integer variables (reversed and temporary calculations): O(1)
- No additional data structures or arrays are created
- Space usage is independent of input size

```c
bool isPalindrome(int x) {
    // Return false for negative numbers or non-zero numbers ending in 0
    if (x < 0 || (x != 0 && x % 10 == 0)) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Initialize variable to store the reversed number
    int reversed = 0;
    
    // Reverse the second half of the number
    while (x > reversed) {
        reversed = reversed * 10 + x % 10; // Append last digit to reversed
        x /= 10; // Remove last digit from x
    }
    
    // Check if number is palindrome (handles even and odd digit lengths)
    return x == reversed || x == reversed / 10;
}
```
