## Notes

This solution solves the climbing stairs problem using dynamic programming with optimized space:

1. Recognize this as the Fibonacci sequence problem:
   - To reach step n: either come from (n-1) by taking 1 step, or from (n-2) by taking 2 steps
   - Therefore, ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)
2. Use bottom-up approach with only O(1) space:
   - Track just the previous two values instead of an entire array
   - Update variables iteratively from step 2 to n
3. Handle the base case where n = 1 separately (only 1 way)

The key insight is that this problem follows the Fibonacci pattern exactly, where F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) with starting values F(1) = 1 and F(0) = 1 (in this context).

### Time Complexity: O(n)

Where n is the number of steps:

- We iterate once from step 2 to step n
- Each iteration performs constant time operations
- Overall complexity is O(n)

### Space Complexity: O(1)

The algorithm uses constant extra space:

- Only uses three integer variables regardless of input size: O(1)
- No additional data structures are created
- This is an optimization over the O(n) space approach that would store all intermediate values

```c
int climbStairs(int n) {
    // Handle base case for n = 1
    if (n == 1) {
        return 1;
    }   
    
    // Initialize variables for the number of ways to reach previous steps
    int prev_one_step = 1; // Ways to reach step i-1
    int prev_two_steps = 1; // Ways to reach step i-2
    int current_ways; // Ways to reach current step
    
    // Iterate from step 2 to n
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        // Ways to reach current step = ways to reach (i-1) + ways to reach (i-2)
        current_ways = prev_one_step + prev_two_steps;
        // Update previous steps for next iteration
        prev_two_steps = prev_one_step;
        prev_one_step = current_ways;
    }
    
    // Return the number of ways to reach the top
    return prev_one_step;
}
```
