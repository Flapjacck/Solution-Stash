# [221. Maximal Square](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-square/description/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1691285577/)

## Notes

This solution uses dynamic programming with space optimization to find the largest square containing only 1s:

1. Use a 1D DP array instead of 2D to optimize space
2. For each cell (i,j), dp[j] represents the side length of the largest square ending at that position
3. The recurrence relation: if matrix[i][j] == '1', then dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j-1], prev) + 1
   - dp[j]: square from above
   - dp[j-1]: square from left
   - prev: square from diagonal (top-left)
4. Track the maximum side length found and return its area

The key insight is that a square can only be formed if all three neighboring squares (top, left, diagonal) exist.

### Time Complexity: O(m * n)

Where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns:

- We iterate through each cell in the matrix exactly once
- Each cell operation (min calculation and updates) takes O(1)
- Overall complexity is O(m * n)

### Space Complexity: O(n)

Where n is the number of columns:

- We use a 1D DP array of size (n + 1) instead of 2D array
- A few additional variables (p, t, max_side) use O(1) space
- Space optimization reduces from O(m * n) to O(n)

```python
class Solution:
    def maximalSquare(self, matrix: list[list[str]]) -> int:
        # Get matrix dimensions
        r, c = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        # Initialize dp array with zeros
        d = [0] * (c + 1)
        # Track maximum square side length
        max_side = 0
    
        # Iterate through each row
        for i in range(1, r + 1):
            # Store previous value for diagonal
            p = 0
            # Iterate through each column
            for j in range(1, c + 1):
                # Save current dp value
                t = d[j]
                # If current cell is '1', calculate square size
                if matrix[i - 1][j - 1] == '1':
                    d[j] = min(d[j], d[j - 1], p) + 1
                    # Update maximum square side length
                    max_side = max(max_side, d[j])
                else:
                    # Reset dp value if cell is '0'
                    d[j] = 0
                # Update previous value
                p = t
    
        # Return area of largest square
        return max_side ** 2
