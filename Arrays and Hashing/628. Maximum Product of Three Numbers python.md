# [628. Maximum Product of Three Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-three-numbers/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1612774345/)

## Notes

This solution finds the maximum product of three numbers in the array by considering two possible cases:

1. Product of three largest numbers (for all positive or all negative numbers)
2. Product of two smallest numbers and the largest number (for cases with negative numbers)

The approach:

1. Sort the array in ascending order
2. Compare two possible products:
   - Three largest numbers (a[-1] * a[-2] * a[-3])
   - Two smallest numbers and largest number (a[0] * a[1] * a[-1])
3. Return the maximum of these two products

This handles all cases including:

- All positive numbers
- All negative numbers
- Mix of positive and negative numbers

### Time Complexity: O(n log n)

- Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time
- Finding the maximum product takes O(1) time
- Overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting: O(n log n)

### Space Complexity: O(1)

- The space used is constant regardless of input size
- Python's Timsort is used internally but we don't count that as additional space
- Only a few variables are used to store the final calculation

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        a = sorted(nums)
        return max(a[-1]*a[-2]*a[-3], a[0]*a[1]*a[-1])     
```
