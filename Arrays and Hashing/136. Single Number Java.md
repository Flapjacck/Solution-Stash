# 136. Single Number

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1501220679/)

## Notes

- **Iterate Through Array**:
   - Iterate through each number in the array.
   - Use the XOR operation to find the single number.
   - XOR of a number with itself is 0 and XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
   - This will cancel out all numbers appearing twice and leave the single number.

- **Return Result**:
   - Return the single number stored in `result`.

```java
public class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        // Initialize result to 0
        int result = 0;
        
        // Iterate through each number in the array
        for (int num : nums) {
            // Use XOR operation to find the single number
            // XOR of a number with itself is 0 and XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself
            // This will cancel out all numbers appearing twice and leave the single number
            result ^= num;
        }
        
        // Return the single number
        return result;
    }
}
```
