# [27. Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/description/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1582601369/)

## Notes

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function `removeElement` takes an integer array `nums` and a value `val` to remove.
   - An integer `index` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the position where elements should be placed.

2. **Two-Pointer Approach**:
   - The function uses two pointers: `i` for iterating through the array and `index` for tracking the position to place valid elements.

3. **Processing Elements**:
   - For each element at position `i`, it checks if the element is equal to the target value `val`.
   - If the element is not equal to `val`, it is placed at position `index` and `index` is incremented.
   - If the element equals `val`, it is effectively skipped as `index` remains unchanged.

4. **In-Place Modification**:
   - The algorithm modifies the array in-place, overwriting values that are equal to `val`.
   - All elements not equal to `val` are moved to the front of the array.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - The function returns `index`, which represents the new length of the array with all occurrences of `val` removed.

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int index = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != val) {
                nums[index] = nums[i];
                index++;
            }
        }
        return index;
    }
}
```
