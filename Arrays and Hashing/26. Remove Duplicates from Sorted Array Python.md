# [26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1712641778/)

## Notes

This solution removes duplicates from a sorted array in-place using the two-pointer technique:

1. Use unique_pos pointer to track the position of the last unique element
2. Use current_pos pointer to iterate through the array starting from index 1
3. When a new unique element is found (nums[unique_pos] != nums[current_pos]):
   - Increment unique_pos to the next position
   - Copy the unique element to nums[unique_pos]
4. Return unique_pos + 1 as the length of the array with unique elements

The key insight is that since the array is sorted, duplicates are adjacent, so we only need to compare each element with the previous unique element.

### Time Complexity: O(n)

Where n is the length of the input array:

- Single pass through the array with the current_pos pointer: O(n)
- Each comparison and assignment operation takes O(1)
- Overall complexity is O(n)

### Space Complexity: O(1)

The algorithm modifies the array in-place:

- Only uses two integer pointers (unique_pos and current_pos): O(1)
- No additional data structures are created
- All operations are performed in-place

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize pointer for the last unique element
        unique_pos = 0
        
        # Iterate through array starting from second element
        for current_pos in range(1, len(nums)):
            # If current element differs from last unique element
            if nums[unique_pos] != nums[current_pos]:
                # Move unique pointer forward and copy current element
                unique_pos += 1
                nums[unique_pos] = nums[current_pos]
        
        # Return length of unique elements
        return unique_pos + 1
```
