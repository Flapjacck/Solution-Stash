# [324. Wiggle Sort II](https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-sort-ii/description/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1619442474/)

## Notes

This solution rearranges the array in a wiggle pattern (nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3]...) using the following approach:

1. Create a copy of the input array to preserve original order
2. Sort the copy in descending order to get larger numbers first
3. Place the larger numbers in odd indices (1, 3, 5...)
4. Place the remaining numbers in even indices (0, 2, 4...)
5. This ensures nums[1] > nums[0] < nums[3] > nums[2] pattern

### Time Complexity: O(n log n)

Where n is the length of the input array:

- Making a copy of the array: O(n)
- Sorting the temporary array: O(n log n)
- Two passes through the array to place elements: O(n)
- Overall complexity is dominated by the sorting: O(n log n)

### Space Complexity: O(n)

Where n is the length of the input array:

- We create a temporary array (temp) that stores all n elements: O(n)
- The space used for sorting is typically O(log n) for Python's Timsort
- Overall space complexity is O(n)

```python
class Solution:
    def wiggleSort(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        # Make a copy and sort in descending order
        temp = nums.copy()
        temp.sort(reverse = True)
        
        # Place larger numbers in odd indices
        for i in range(1, len(nums), 2):
            nums[i] = temp.pop(0)
            
        # Place remaining numbers in even indices
        for i in range(0, len(nums), 2):
            nums[i] = temp.pop(0)
        return
```
