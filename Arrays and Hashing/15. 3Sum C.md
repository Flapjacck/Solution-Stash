# 15. 3Sum

## Notes

- Start by sorting the array in non-decreasing order to make it easier to handle duplicates and use two pointers.
- Use a loop to fix one element at a time (let's call it `nums[i]`).
- If `nums[i]` is the same as the previous element, skip it to avoid duplicate triplets.
- Use two pointers:
  - Left pointer (`left`) at `i + 1`.
  - Right pointer (`right`) at the end of the array.
- Check triplet sum:
  - Calculate `total = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]`.
  - If `total == 0`, it's a valid triplet. Add it to the result, then move both `left` and `right` pointers inward, skipping duplicates.
  - If `total < 0`, move the `left` pointer right to increase the sum.
  - If `total > 0`, move the `right` pointer left to decrease the sum.
- Repeat until `left` >= `right`. Continue adjusting the pointers for each fixed `nums[i]`.
- After processing all elements, return the list of unique triplets.
