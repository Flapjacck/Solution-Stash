## Notes

This solution implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s (representing red, white, and blue). The algorithm works by:

1. Using nested loops to compare adjacent elements
2. Swapping elements if they are in the wrong order
3. Continuing until the entire array is sorted

### Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)

The solution uses two nested loops, where n is the length of the input array:

- Outer loop runs n-1 times
- Inner loop runs n-i times for each i
This results in a quadratic time complexity

### Space Complexity: O(1)

The solution modifies the array in-place and only uses a single temporary variable for swapping, resulting in constant space complexity

```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """

        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                    temp = nums[i]
                    nums[i] = nums[j]
                    nums[j] = temp
        return nums
```
