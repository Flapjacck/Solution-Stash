# [463. Island Perimeter](https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1560569152/)

## Notes

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function `islandPerimeter` takes a 2D integer array `grid` as input.
   - An integer `output` is initialized to 0 to store the perimeter of the island.

2. **Iterating Through the Grid**:
   - The function uses nested `for` loops to iterate through each cell in the grid.

3. **Checking for Land Cells**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, it checks if the cell contains land (`grid[i][j] == 1`).
   - If it does, `output` is incremented by 4 (each land cell initially contributes 4 to the perimeter).

4. **Adjusting for Adjacent Land Cells**:
   - The function then checks the four possible adjacent cells (left, right, top, bottom):
     - If the left cell `(i, j-1)` is within bounds and contains land, `output` is decremented by 1.
     - If the right cell `(i, j+1)` is within bounds and contains land, `output` is decremented by 1.
     - If the top cell `(i-1, j)` is within bounds and contains land, `output` is decremented by 1.
     - If the bottom cell `(i+1, j)` is within bounds and contains land, `output` is decremented by 1.

```java
class Solution {
    public int islandPerimeter(int[][] grid) {
        int output = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[i].length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    output += 4;

                    if ( j-1 >= 0  && grid[i][j-1] == 1)  output -= 1;

                    if ( j+1 != grid[i].length && grid[i][j+1] == 1)  output -=1;

                    if (i-1 >= 0 && grid[i-1][j] == 1)   output -= 1;
                    
                    if (i+1 != grid.length && grid[i+1][j] == 1) output -=1;                    
                }
            }
        }
        return output;
    }
}
