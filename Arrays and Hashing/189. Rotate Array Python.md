# [189. Rotate Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/description/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1688721222/)

## Notes

This solution rotates an array to the right by k steps using a three-step reversal approach:

1. Handle edge case where k > n by using k %= n (since rotating by n is same as no rotation)
2. Reverse the entire array
3. Reverse the first k elements
4. Reverse the remaining n-k elements

This approach works because:

- Original: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k=3
- After step 2: [7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
- After step 3: [5,6,7,4,3,2,1] (reverse first 3)
- After step 4: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4] (reverse last 4)

### Time Complexity: O(n)

Where n is the length of the array:

- Reversing entire array: O(n)
- Reversing first k elements: O(k)
- Reversing last n-k elements: O(n-k)
- Total: O(n) + O(k) + O(n-k) = O(n)

### Space Complexity: O(1)

The algorithm modifies the array in-place:

- No additional arrays or data structures are created
- Only uses a constant amount of extra space for variables
- All reversals are done in-place

```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        n = len(nums)
        # Handle case where k > n (rotating by n is same as no rotation)
        k %= n
        
        # Step 1: Reverse the entire array
        nums.reverse()
        
        # Step 2: Reverse the first k elements
        nums[:k] = reversed(nums[:k])
        
        # Step 3: Reverse the remaining n-k elements
        nums[k:] = reversed(nums[k:])
```
