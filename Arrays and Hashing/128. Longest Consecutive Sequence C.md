# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1446231815/)

## Notes

- Sort the array so the consecutive numbers are next to each other
- Need to iterate through the array to find a number that is the start of a sequence
- Then check the next number to see if it is consecutive
- Keep track of the longest sequence found
- Skip duplicates and break the sequence if the next number is not consecutive
- Return the longest sequence found

```c
int longestConsecutive(int* nums, int numsSize) {
    //return 0 if empty array
    if (numsSize == 0) return 0;

    //Auxiliary function to compare two integers, used for qsort
    int compare(const void *a, const void *b) {
        return (*(int*)a - *(int*)b);
    }

    //Sort the array
    qsort(nums, numsSize, sizeof(int), compare);
    
    //Variables to store longest sequence
    int longest = 1;
    int count = 1;

    //Iterate through the array
    for (int i = 1; i < numsSize; i++) {
        if (nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) {
            //Skip duplicates
            continue;
        } else if (nums[i] == nums[i - 1] + 1) {
            //Increment count if consecutive
            count++;
        } else {
            //Update longest if needed and reset count
            if (count > longest) {
                longest = count;
            }
            count = 1;
        }
    }

    //Return the maximum of the last sequence and the longest found
    return count > longest ? count : longest;
}
```
