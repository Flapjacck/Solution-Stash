# [153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1690059959/)

## Notes

This solution uses binary search to find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array:

1. Use two pointers (left and right) to define the search space
2. Calculate the middle index and compare nums[mid] with nums[right]
3. If nums[mid] <= nums[right], the minimum is in the left half (including mid)
   - Move right pointer to mid
4. If nums[mid] > nums[right], the minimum is in the right half
   - Move left pointer to mid + 1
5. Continue until left == right, which points to the minimum element

The key insight is that in a rotated sorted array:

- If nums[mid] <= nums[right], the right portion is sorted, so minimum is in left half
- If nums[mid] > nums[right], there's a rotation point in the right half

### Time Complexity: O(log n)

Where n is the length of the array:

- Binary search reduces the search space by half in each iteration
- Maximum number of iterations is logâ‚‚(n)
- Each comparison and pointer update is O(1)

### Space Complexity: O(1)

The algorithm uses constant extra space:

- Only uses three variables: left (l), right (r), and middle (m)
- No additional data structures are created
- All operations are performed in-place

```python
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize left and right pointers
        l = 0
        r = len(nums) - 1

        # Binary search to find the minimum
        while l < r:
            # Calculate middle index
            m = (l + r) // 2

            # If middle element is less than or equal to right, minimum is in left half
            if nums[m] <= nums[r]:
                r = m
            # Otherwise, minimum is in right half
            else:
                l = m + 1
        # Return the minimum element
        return nums[l]
```
