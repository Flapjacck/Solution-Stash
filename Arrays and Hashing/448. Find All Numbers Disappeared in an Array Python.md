# [448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array/description/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1629668533/)

## Notes

- The problem is asking to find all the numbers in the range 1 to n that are missing from the array. The array contains n numbers, and each number is between 1 and n (inclusive).
- The solution uses a set to store the numbers in the array and then checks for each number in the range 1 to n if it is present in the set. If not, it adds that number to the result list.

```python
class Solution:
    def findDisappearedNumbers(self, numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        number_set = set(numbers)
        missing_numbers = []

        for i in range(1, len(numbers) + 1):
            if i not in number_set:
                missing_numbers.append(i)
        return missing_numbers
```
