# [655. Print Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/print-binary-tree/description/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1626533345/)

## Notes

This solution prints a binary tree in a m x n 2D string array using these steps:

1. Calculate the height of the tree to determine dimensions
2. Create a grid where:
   - Number of rows (m) = height of tree
   - Number of columns (n) = 2^height - 1
3. Use DFS to fill the grid where:
   - Root is placed in middle of first row
   - Left child offset = current_offset/2 to left
   - Right child offset = current_offset/2 to right
4. Empty spaces are represented by empty strings

### Time Complexity: O(h * 2^h)

Where h is the height of the tree:

- Getting height of tree: O(n) where n is number of nodes
- Creating the grid: O(h * 2^h) for dimensions m × n
- Filling the grid with DFS: O(n) to visit each node
- Overall complexity dominated by grid creation: O(h * 2^h)

### Space Complexity: O(h * 2^h)

Where h is the height of the tree:

- Grid space: O(h * 2^h) for m × n grid where:
  - m = height = h
  - n = 2^h - 1 ≈ 2^h
- Recursion stack space: O(h) for DFS calls
- Overall space complexity: O(h * 2^h)

            if offset > 0:
                next_offset = offset // 2
                fill_grid(node.left, grid, row + 1, col - offset, next_offset)
                fill_grid(node.right, grid, row + 1, col + offset, next_offset)

        # Get the height of the tree
        height = get_height(root)
        if height == 0:
            return []

        # Calculate grid dimensions
        width = 2 ** height - 1
        grid = [["" for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]

        # Calculate initial offset for root's children
        initial_offset = 2 ** (height - 2) if height >= 2 else 0

        # Fill the grid starting from the root
        fill_grid(root, grid, 0, (width - 1) // 2, initial_offset)
        return grid
