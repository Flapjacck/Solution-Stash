# [101. Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1819898666/)

## Notes

- `bool checkNodeSym(struct TreeNode* r, struct TreeNode* l)`: Helper function to recursively check if two subtrees are mirror images
  - If both nodes are NULL, return true (both subtrees are symmetric)
  - If only one node is NULL, return false (asymmetric)
  - If node values differ, return false (asymmetric)
  - Recursively compare the left subtree of one side with the right subtree of the other side, and vice versa
- `bool isSymmetric(struct TreeNode* root)`: Main function to check if the tree is symmetric
  - If the tree is empty, return true
  - Call the helper function to compare left and right subtrees of the root

### Time Complexity: O(n)

Where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree:

- We visit each node exactly once during the recursive traversal
- Each comparison and recursive call takes O(1)
- Overall complexity is O(n)

### Space Complexity: O(h)

Where h is the height of the binary tree:

- Recursion stack space: O(h) for function calls
- In worst case (skewed tree): h = n, so O(n)
- In best case (balanced tree): h = log(n), so O(log n)
- No additional data structures are used
- Overall space complexity is O(h)

```c
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     struct TreeNode *left;
 *     struct TreeNode *right;
 * };
 */

bool checkNodeSym(struct TreeNode* r, struct TreeNode* l) {
    //check if both node are empty
    if (r == NULL && l == NULL) return true;
    //only one node is empty 
    else if (r == NULL || l == NULL) return false;
    // check is r and l nodes have the same value
    else if (r->val != l->val) return false;
    //compare left and right subtrees children on both sides of tree
    return checkNodeSym(r->left, l->right) && checkNodeSym(r->right, l->left);
}

bool isSymmetric(struct TreeNode* root) {
    //check if tree is empty
    if (root == NULL) return true;
    // call recursive funtion to iterate through the tree nodes
    return checkNodeSym(root->right, root->left);

}
