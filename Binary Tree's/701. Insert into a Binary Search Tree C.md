# 701. Insert into a Binary Search Tree

## [Solution Link]()

## Notes

- If the root is NULL, create a new node with the given val and return it. This handles the case where the tree is initially empty.

- If val is less than root->val, recursively insert val into the left subtree.

- If val is greater than root->val, recursively insert val into the right subtree.

- After insertion, return the root of the tree.
