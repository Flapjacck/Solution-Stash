# [450. Delete Node in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/description/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1618526687/)

## Notes

This solution implements the deletion operation in a Binary Search Tree (BST) by handling three main cases:

1. Node to delete is a leaf node (no children)
2. Node to delete has one child
3. Node to delete has two children
   - Find the largest value in left subtree (predecessor)
   - Replace current node's value with predecessor
   - Delete the predecessor node recursively

### Time Complexity: O(h)

Where h is the height of the tree:

- In a balanced BST, h = log(n) where n is number of nodes
- In worst case (skewed tree), h = n
- We traverse down the tree once to find the node: O(h)
- In case of two children, finding predecessor takes O(h)

### Space Complexity: O(h)

Where h is the height of the tree:

- The recursion stack can go as deep as the height of the tree
- In a balanced BST: O(log n)
- In worst case (skewed tree): O(n)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], key: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        # Base case: if tree is empty or we've reached end of path
        if not root:
            return root

        # Recursively search in left subtree if key is smaller
        if key < root.val:
            root.left = self.deleteNode(root.left, key)
        # Recursively search in right subtree if key is larger
        elif key > root.val:
            root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, key)
        # Found the node to delete
        else:
            # Case 1: Leaf node - simply remove it
            if not root.left and not root.right:
                return None
            # Case 2: One child - replace node with its child
            if not root.left or not root.right:
                return root.left if root.left else root.right

            # Case 3: Two children
            # Find largest value in left subtree (predecessor)
            temp = root.left
            while temp.right:
                temp = temp.right
            # Replace current node's value with predecessor
            root.val = temp.val
            # Delete the predecessor node
            root.left = self.deleteNode(root.left, temp.val)

        return root
