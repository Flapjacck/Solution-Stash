# [102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/description/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1615871010/)

## Notes

This solution uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach with a queue to traverse the binary tree level by level:

1. We use a queue to store nodes at each level
2. For each level, we process all nodes currently in the queue
3. While processing each node, we:
   - Add its value to the current level's result
   - Add its left and right children (if they exist) to the queue
4. Each iteration of the while loop represents one level of the tree

### Time Complexity: O(n)

Where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node exactly once and perform constant time operations for each node.

### Space Complexity: O(w)

Where w is the maximum width of the binary tree (the maximum number of nodes at any level). In the worst case, this could be n/2 for a complete binary tree at its last level.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if not root: return []

        queue = deque([root])
        result = []

        while queue:
            level_size = len(queue)
            current_level = []

            for _ in range(level_size):
                node = queue.popleft()
                current_level.append(node.val)

                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
            result.append(current_level)
        return result
```
