# [310. Minimum Height Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/description/)

## [Solution Link](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1617677133/)

## Notes

This solution uses a topological sorting approach to find the root nodes that would result in minimum height trees:

1. Build an adjacency list representation of the tree using a defaultdict
2. Keep track of the degree (number of connections) for each node
3. Start with leaf nodes (nodes with degree 1) and remove them layer by layer
4. The process continues until we have 1 or 2 nodes left, which will be the roots of minimum height trees
5. The key insight is that the roots must be the middle nodes of the longest path in the tree

### Time Complexity: O(n)

Where n is the number of nodes in the tree:

- Building the graph takes O(n) as we process each edge once
- The BFS process visits each node exactly once
- Each node is added and removed from the queue at most once

### Space Complexity: O(n)

Where n is the number of nodes in the tree:

- The adjacency list (graph) stores all edges: O(n)
- The degrees array stores degree for each node: O(n)
- The queue can store at most n/2 leaf nodes at any time: O(n)

```python
class Solution:
    def findMinHeightTrees(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        if n == 1:
            return [0]

        graph = defaultdict(list)
        degrees = [0] * n

        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)
            degrees[u] += 1
            degrees[v] += 1

        queue = deque()
        for i in range(n):
            if degrees[i] == 1:
                queue.append(i)

        remaining_nodes = n
        while remaining_nodes > 2:
            size = len(queue)
            remaining_nodes -= size

            for _ in range(size):
                leaf = queue.popleft()
                for neighbor in graph[leaf]:
                    degrees[neighbor] -= 1
                    if degrees[neighbor] == 1:
                        queue.append(neighbor)
        return list(queue)
```
